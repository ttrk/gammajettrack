(- make PbPb - pp for trkPt > 4 GeV)
(- try all pf candidates)
- try to turn isolation off to see if it becomes flat  - running - done - merged
- first look at ff in the cone then move far away      - 
- check if z has correlation with event plane angle    - 
- check Zmm only to see if bump is still there         - 
- lower mu pt cut to 10                                - done
- try w/o tracking corrections                         - 
- add jet back in for photons                          - 
- raise photon et cut all the wayyyy up                - 
- change track cuts to those in Readme file            - running
